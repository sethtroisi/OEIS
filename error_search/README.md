Inspect

* https://oeis.org/A145985 -> 753 seem wrong
* https://oeis.org/A177378 -> 67108861 seem wrong
* https://oeis.org/A195258 -> 7173 seem wrong (and probably related sequence https://oeis.org/A187825)
* https://oeis.org/A212605 -> 351439 seem wrong
* https://oeis.org/A228851 -> 1037917517 seem wrong (and probably related sequences)

Manual finds

* https://oeis.org/A000022 -> Mathematica code disagrees at 50 (560915929775897218 vs 559792108243652284)
  * Jean-FranÃ§ois Alcover's Mathematica program matches NJA Sloane's

* https://oeis.org/A228988 - Python code should be read(2, 10 ** a + 2), Mathematica code misses a digit too

* https://oeis.org/A003371 - Example is for https://oeis.org/A003367


TODO

* https://oeis.org/A126788 -> 51 should be 61
