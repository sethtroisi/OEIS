### Past work and other links

* [WorldOfNumbers has a page](http://www.worldofnumbers.com/topic1.htm) on the
first 100 home primes and their history.

* [WraithX](https://mersenneforum.org/showthread.php?p=389048#post389048) has
relentlessly pursuit HP49 since at least 2011. They factored a c210 in step
106, a c211 in step 107, a c218 in step 109, a c181 in step 110, a c196 in
step 112, and a tough c159 in step
113[1](http://www.worldofnumbers.com/topic1.htm#info16).
They continue to work on the HP48(117).c210,
[checking up to t65 via

* [FactorDB](http://www.factordb.com/sequences.php?se=10&aq=372&action=all&fr=0&to=100)
has home primes in a number of bases as sequences,
